🚀 Steam Hour Manager
A lightweight WPF application designed to manage and idle your Steam game hours using an exe-swap method.

✨ Features
Library Scan: Automatically finds all your installed Steam games.

Idling: Renames the game's original executable and replaces it with a cmd dummy to track hours with near 0% CPU/GPU usage.

API Integration: Connect your Steam Web API to sync real-time playtime directly into the app.

UI: Modern, dark-themed interface built with WPF-UI.

🛠️ Requirements
.NET 10.0 Runtime

Steam Client installed and logged in.

🚀 Quick Start

Setup API: (Optional) Add your Steam Web API Key and SteamID64 in Settings for accurate hour tracking.

⚠️ Disclaimer & Safety
Use at your own risk: This tool modifies local game files by renaming executables. While it does not modify game memory or inject code, always ensure you "Stop Boost" or use the 'Repair Files' button before joining VAC-secured servers.

File Restoration: If a game doesn't launch or the app closes unexpectedly, the 'Repair Files' button in the game options will restore the original .exe.
